# IOSüì±Code Path Prework - My Newbie Tap

Submitted by: Shimin Chan

My Newbie Tap is my first attempt at an iOS app. It's a very simple app that includes three labels and a button that can change the background color randomly.

Time spent: 4 hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- ‚úÖ Users are see a screen with three labels and a button
- ‚úÖ Tapping the button changes the screen color to a random color

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
1Ô∏è‚É£ Wine Inventory Tracking App
 - Display the current stock of wines for a restaurant or wine store
 - Calculate and show the profit margin for each wine
 - Allow users to add or remove wines from the inventory

2Ô∏è‚É£ Diary App
- Add extra security, such as a password lock, when opening the app
- Allow users to write daily journal entries with text, emoji, or insert pictures

3Ô∏è‚É£ Activities suggestion app
- Generates healthy activity suggestions for users based on the time they select
- Provides detailed instructions or tips on how to perform each activity
- Stretch Goal: Allow users to select unhealthy activities as well

üí° New idea or an improvement on an existing app:
I want to build an app that allows users to connect to a (Point of Sales) POS system, whether it is in a restaurant or a supermarket. The app will enable users to check the inventory of each item and will also send notifications via email or text when stock levels are low, ensuring timely reordering. Additionally, the system will showcase other products from the same vendor, making restocking easier and promoting related sales. The app can also show the buying price, selling price, and the margin cost of each item.

## Notes
Challenges encountered while building the app:
This was my first time using Xcode. In the beginning, following the prework guidelines was smooth and clear. However, the challenge I faced was that the instructions seemed to be based on an older version of Xcode, not Xcode 16, which made it a little harder to follow them exactly. The trickiest part was learning how to hold the Control key and drag the button from the canvas to the ViewController.swift file. At first, I didn‚Äôt drag it to the correct spot, so I tried to write the code manually instead. After completing the code, I was able to successfully make the connection by dragging. It turned out to be a great learning experience because I now understand both ways.
