## Notes

This was my first time using Xcode. In the beginning, following the prework guidelines was smooth and clear. However, the challenge I faced was that the instructions seemed to be based on an older version of Xcode, not Xcode 16, which made it a little harder to follow them exactly. The trickiest part was learning how to hold the Control key and drag the button from the canvas to the ViewController.swift file. At first, I didn’t drag it to the correct spot, so I tried to write the code manually instead. After completing the code, I was able to successfully make the connection by dragging. It turned out to be a great learning experience because I now understand both ways.
